# Step-by-Step Usage
# 1. Download the Script
Save the script as karaworm.py on your local machine.

# 2. Modify the Script (Optional)
Update the PAYLOAD_URL variable to point to your payload (if applicable).

Customize the COMMON_USERNAMES and COMMON_PASSWORDS lists for SSH bruteforcing.

# 3. Run the Script
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.

# Run the script using Python:

python karaworm.py

# What the Script Does

# Network Scanning:

Scans the local network for hosts with port 22 (SSH) open.

Identifies the gateway and scans the /24 subnet.

# SSH Bruteforcing:

Attempts to connect to SSH servers using a list of common usernames and passwords.

If successful, it logs the credentials and uploads a file (backdoor.exe) to the target machine.

# Self-Replication:

Spreads the script to other drives and the startup folder to ensure persistence.

# Payload Delivery:

Downloads and executes a payload from a remote URL (if configured).

# Privilege Escalation:

Attempts to escalate privileges on the local machine.

# Example Use Case
Scenario:
You are performing a penetration test on a lab network to identify vulnerabilities in SSH configurations.

# Steps:
Set Up the Lab:

Configure a virtual machine with SSH enabled and weak credentials (e.g., root:karma123).

Run the Script:

Execute the script in the lab environment:

python karaworm.py

Monitor Output:

The script will scan the network, bruteforce SSH credentials, and attempt to execute commands on compromised hosts.

Analyze Results:

Review the logs to identify vulnerabilities and improve security configurations.
